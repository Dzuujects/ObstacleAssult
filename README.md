Developed a platforming game that requires the player to move from platform to platform to reach the keystone at the end.

- Structure of C++ Syntax
- How to create classes in C++
- Member Variables and Functions
- Blueprint child classes of C++
- UPROPERTY and UE_LOG uses
- FString, FVector, and FRotator in C++ for Unreal Engine
- GameMode and Character Classes
