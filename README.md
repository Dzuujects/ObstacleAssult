Developed a platforming game that requires the player to move from platform to platform to reach the keystone at the end.

Used the Unreal Engine Starter Kit From fab.com for the designs. Coded Moving Platforms and Rotating Platform with C++ which then is connected with a static mesh from the starter kit.

Extended knowledge of Blueprint and Unreal Engine and learnt how to code in C++ for Unreal Engine.
